## About LIRI Bot
LIRI Bot is like siri but for movies and music! The user can search for song information, movie information, and get a list of concerts that an artist is playing.

## How to Use
After cloning, type `npm install` in the terminal while in the project's directory. This will install the correct dependencies to ensure the app runs correctly.

The app itself is pretty self-explanatory. The user selects which type of search they would like to run, then input the title or artist as necessary. They can also select "Search what's in random.txt" to run the command stored inside random.txt.
